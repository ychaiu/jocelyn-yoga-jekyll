            I am available to schedule private sessions for those interested in starting their yoga practice with a strong foundation or relieving physical tension or mental stress. Through private sessions I am able to offer focused one-on-one sessions tailored to your individual needs and goals, which allows for greater attention and guidance than would otherwise be possible in a group setting. 
            
            Individuals session rates are available on a sliding scale depending on your financial circumstances.

      text: As a former tax accountant, I am familiar with the experience of working in a high-stress environment. Although it was always seemed like a miracle to be able to make time for yoga during the busy season, I don't recall ever regretting it when I dragged myself to a class. I am available to schedule yoga sessions at your office. Promoting yoga, health, and wellbeing in the workplace can help employees increase productivity and gain a deeper sense of happiness and job satisfaction. Invest in your employees' wellness.
